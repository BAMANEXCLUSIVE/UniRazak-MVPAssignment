# Grid View

In 2.3.0 the Tree view was completely rebuilt using React and renamed to Grid. Here is a primer on the new technologies used:

## [React](https://reactjs.org/)

The most popular javascript framework for building user interfaces with reusable components.
Written as javascript and html together in `.jsx` files.
In-component state can be managed via `useState()`, application state that spans many components can be managed via a context provider (see `/context` for examples), API state can be managed by React Query (see below)

## [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

A good component and helper function library. Tooltips, modals, toasts, switches, etc are all out of the box
Styles are applied via global theme when initializing the app or inline with individual components like `<Box padding="5px" />`

## [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

A powerful async data handler that makes it easy to manage loading/error states as well as caching, refetching, background updates, etc.
This is our state management for any data that comes from an API.
Each API request is its own hook. Ie `useTasks` will get all the tasks for a DAG

## [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

Easily write tests for react components and hooks

## Instructions for Integrating the JavaScript Files with the Project

To integrate the JavaScript files with the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Import the required JavaScript files into your project. For example, to use the Grid View component, add the following import statement to your main JavaScript file:
   ```javascript
   import GridView from './path/to/GridView';
   ```

4. Use the imported component in your application. For example, you can render the Grid View component in your main application file:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import GridView from './path/to/GridView';

   const App = () => (
     <div>
       <h1>Project Management Tool</h1>
       <GridView />
     </div>
   );

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

5. Start the development server to see the changes:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

By following these steps, you can integrate the JavaScript files with your project and start using the components provided by the Project Management Tool.
