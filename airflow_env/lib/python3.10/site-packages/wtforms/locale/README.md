Translations
============

WTForms uses gettext to provide translations. Translations for various
strings rendered by WTForms are created and updated by the community. If
you notice that your locale is missing, or find a translation error,
please submit a fix.


Create
------

To create a translation, initialize a catalog in the new locale:

```
$ python setup.py init_catalog --locale <your locale>
```

This will create some folders under the locale name and copy the
template.

Edit
----

After creating a translation, or to edit an existing translation, open
the ``.po`` file. While they can be edited by hand, there are also tools
that make working with gettext files easier.

Make sure the `.po` file:

- Is a valid UTF-8 text file.
- Has the header filled out appropriately.
- Translates all messages.


Verify
------

After working on the catalog, verify that it compiles and produces the
correct translations.

```
$ python setup.py compile_catalog
```

Try loading your translations into some sample code to verify they look
correct.


Submit
------

To submit your translation, create a pull request on GitHub.

Integrating Locale Files
========================

To integrate the locale files with your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the locale files are placed in the appropriate directory within your project structure.
2. Configure your project to use the locale files for translations.
3. Test the integration to ensure that the translations are working correctly.

For more information on integrating locale files, refer to the [WTForms documentation](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/).
