## Automating with GitHub Actions: Marketing Campaign Management

### Description
This guide demonstrates how to automate the setup and workflows for managing a marketing campaign using GitHub Actions. The workflows include installing dependencies, running tasks, and integrating with Apache Airflow for automated updates.

### Features Automated
- **Task Management**: Automate task creation and updates.
- **Dependency Installation**: Ensure all required tools and libraries are installed.
- **Integration with Apache Airflow**: Schedule and monitor workflows seamlessly.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

#### 1. Workflow for Dependency Installation
Create a file named `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Install Dependencies

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    install-dependencies:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
                python-version: '3.9'

        - name: Install Dependencies
            run: |
                pip install apache-airflow
```

#### 2. Workflow for Apache Airflow Integration
Create a file named `.github/workflows/airflow-integration.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Apache Airflow Integration

on:
    schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight

jobs:
    airflow-integration:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v4
            with:
                python-version: '3.9'

        - name: Install Dependencies
            run: |
                pip install apache-airflow

        - name: Create and Run Airflow DAG
            run: |
                echo "
                from airflow import DAG
                from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
                from datetime import datetime

                def update_project_data():
                        print('Project data updated successfully!')

                with DAG('project_management_updates', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
                        update_task = PythonOperator(
                                task_id='update_project_data',
                                python_callable=update_project_data
                        )
                " > project_dag.py
                python project_dag.py
```

### Steps to Use the Workflows
1. Add the above workflow files to your repository under the `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. Push the changes to the `main` branch.
3. Monitor the workflows in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

For more details on GitHub Actions, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
