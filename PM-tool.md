npm install react vue @nestjs/core koa
```

# Run the script
```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

# Project Management Process Groups
Project management involves several process groups. Here are the key process groups and how they integrate with the main-system and sub-system:

## Initiating
This phase involves defining the project at a broad level. It includes creating a project charter and identifying stakeholders.
- **Main-system**: Set up the initial server and database connections.
- **Sub-system**: Identify necessary utility functions and middleware.

### Script for Initiating
Create a file named `initiate.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set up initial server and database connections for main-system
cd main-system
touch server.js
echo "const express = require('express');" >> server.js
echo "const mongoose = require('mongoose');" >> server.js
echo "require('dotenv').config();" >> server.js

# Identify necessary utility functions and middleware for sub-system
cd ../sub-system
touch utils.js
echo "// Utility functions go here" >> utils.js
touch middleware.js
echo "// Middleware functions go here" >> middleware.js
```

## Planning
In this phase, detailed planning is done to guide the project team. It includes defining the scope, setting objectives, and developing a project management plan.
- **Main-system**: Plan the core functionalities and primary routes.
- **Sub-system**: Plan the auxiliary services and additional functionalities.

### Script for Planning
Create a file named `plan.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Plan core functionalities and primary routes for main-system
cd main-system
touch routes.js
echo "// Define primary routes here" >> routes.js

# Plan auxiliary services and additional functionalities for sub-system
cd ../sub-system
touch services.js
echo "// Define auxiliary services here" >> services.js
```

## Executing
This phase involves coordinating people and resources to carry out the project plan. It includes managing teams, quality assurance, and communication.
- **Main-system**: Implement the server logic, database interactions, and primary routes.
- **Sub-system**: Develop and integrate utility functions, middleware, and additional services.

### Script for Executing
Create a file named `execute.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Implement server logic, database interactions, and primary routes for main-system
cd main-system
echo "const app = express();" >> server.js
echo "mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_URI);" >> server.js
echo "app.use('/', require('./routes'));" >> server.js

# Develop and integrate utility functions, middleware, and additional services for sub-system
cd ../sub-system
echo "module.exports = { /* utility functions */ };" >> utils.js
echo "module.exports = { /* middleware functions */ };" >> middleware.js
```

## Monitoring and Controlling
This phase involves tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project. It includes managing changes and ensuring that project objectives are met.
- **Main-system**: Monitor server performance and database interactions.
- **Sub-system**: Track the performance of utility functions and middleware.

### Script for Monitoring and Controlling
Create a file named `monitor.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Monitor server performance and database interactions for main-system
cd main-system
touch monitor.js
echo "const winston = require('winston');" >> monitor.js
echo "// Monitoring logic here" >> monitor.js

# Track performance of utility functions and middleware for sub-system
cd ../sub-system
touch performance.js
echo "// Performance tracking logic here" >> performance.js
```

## Closing
This phase involves finalizing all project activities. It includes handing over deliverables, releasing project resources, and obtaining stakeholder approval.
- **Main-system**: Finalize server setup and ensure all core functionalities are working.
- **Sub-system**: Ensure all auxiliary services are integrated and functioning properly.

### Script for Closing
Create a file named `close.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

cd main-system
echo "// Finalize server setup" >> server.js

# Ensure all auxiliary services are integrated and functioning properly for sub-system
cd ../sub-system
echo "// Finalize auxiliary services" >> services.js
```

# Interconnection Scripts
To ensure smooth transitions between process groups, create the following interconnection scripts:

### Script for Transition from Initiating to Planning
Create a file named `initiate_to_plan.sh` with the following content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Transition from Initiating to Planning
./initiate.sh
./plan.sh
```

# Integrating Apache Airflow for Project Management Automation

Apache Airflow is a powerful tool for automating workflows and managing tasks. By integrating Airflow into your project management tool, you can automate various project management tasks and ensure that they are executed in a timely and efficient manner.

## Sample DAG for Project Management Updates

Below is a sample Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for automating project management updates using Apache Airflow:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define a Python function for the task
def update_project_data():
    print("Project data updated successfully!")

# Define the DAG
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
}

with DAG(
    dag_id='project_management_updates',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='Automates project management updates',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=['project', 'management'],
) as dag:

    # Define a task
    update_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='update_project_data',
        python_callable=update_project_data,
    )

    # Set task dependencies (if needed)
    update_task
```

This sample DAG defines a simple workflow that updates project data daily. You can customize the DAG to include additional tasks and dependencies based on your project management needs.

For more information on Apache Airflow, refer to the [official documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).
